## üóíÔ∏èMini-WDL Language Server Extension

Welcome to the Mini-WDL Language Server Extension! This project is a Visual Studio Code extension designed to enhance developer productivity for Workflow Description Language (WDL) authors. It integrates advanced language features like syntax highlighting, document symbol detection, and more using a Rust-based Language Server Protocol (LSP) implementation.

## Features
### ‚úÖ Implemented
- Syntax Highlighting: Provides basic syntax highlighting for .wdl files using TextMate grammars.
- Document Symbol Detection: Detects tasks and workflows in .wdl files and displays them in the Outline view.

### ‚ûï Planned Features
- Go-to Definition: Navigate to the definition of tasks and workflows.
- Find References: Locate all references to tasks and workflows across documents.
- Semantic Code Highlighting: Highlight WDL constructs semantically.
- Diagnostics: Provide error checking and diagnostics for WDL files.

### Motivation
The Mini-WDL extension is to improve developer tooling for Workflow Description Language (WDL). It aims to provide a seamless development experience for workflow authors by integrating essential language features into VS Code.

### üéØ Installation
To install the Mini-WDL extension, you will need to install [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started), once rust is installed get on to itüòÅ:


Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/mini-wdl-extension.git
```

Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd mini-wdl-extension
```
Install Node.js dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

Compile the Rust Language Server:

Navigate to the server directory:
```bash
cd server
```
Build the Rust server:
```bash
cargo build
```
After building, ensure the binary exists at server/target/debug/mini-wdl-server.

Return to the root directory:

```bash
cd ..
```
Build the extension:

```bash
npm run compile
```

### Usage
- Open a .wdl file in VS Code.
- The extension will automatically activate and provide syntax highlighting.
- Use the Outline view (Ctrl+Shift+O) to navigate tasks and workflows.
